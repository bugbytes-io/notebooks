    "In this lesson, we will create Python **classes** that model the Euro 2021 football data that has been scraped from the BBC in the previous lesson. In particular, we will create:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A `Result` class that represents a result in the tournament, with attributes for each team and the goals each team scored in the match. We will create methods to determine who won a match, lost a match, whether the result was a draw, and more. \n",
    "- A `TeamStat` class to represent a team's overall statistics in the tournament (goals scored, goals conceded, games won on penalties, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use type-annotated Python [dataclasses](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html) to model the data. We will also look at some \"dunder\" methods from [Python's data model](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html) for modelling certain features in an intuitive, Pythonic way."
